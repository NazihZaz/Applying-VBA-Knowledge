This repository contains my solution of the VBA Homework Assignment: The VBA of Wall Street. I created a VBA script to analyze real stock market data on multiple years.

The VBA script allows to loop through all the stocks for each year and output the information below. Note that the script is the same for 2014, 2015 and 2016 and there is no need to adapt it for each year.

- The ticker symbol.
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year with conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- Greatest % increase. (Value and corresponding ticker)
- Greatest % decrease. (Value and corresponding ticker)
- Greatest total volume. (Value and corresponding ticker)

Below are the Excel screenshots for each year followed by the VBA script:
